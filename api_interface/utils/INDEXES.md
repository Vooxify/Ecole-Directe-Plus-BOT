# API

Here, I will explain how the API works for safe usage. The API is well-designed because it is based on the Route File system (yes, I made up this term, why not :-) ). To explain this simply, when you create a directory in the `./api/` folder, it is transformed into an API route.

## How to create routes?

As I mentioned earlier, you need to create a directory in the `./api/` folder. Then, create a file with the following names based on the method you need:

-   `"post.route.js"` for the POST method
-   `"get.route.js"` for the GET method

> **NOTE**: When you create routes, you can also create subfolders, and it will work as well (as long as there is a file inside xD). You can access it here: **example:** `./api_interface/api/your/subfolder/get.route.js` > `http://localhost:XXXX/api/your/subfolder`

## How to use the API basically?

To start, you've created file(s)â€”good! Now, how do you add logic to the API route? Simple! Export a function like this:

```javascript
module.exports = (req, res) => {};
```

> **NOTE**: The parameters **req** and **res** are necessary. "**req**" represents the request we send, and "**res**" is what we receive in response (just like any other JavaScript request ðŸ˜„).

Afterwards, check out the **[official documentation](https://expressjs.com/fr/)** of the EXPRESS module for more details.
